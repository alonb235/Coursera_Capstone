    "   Using data on the venues present in different neighborhoods of Atlanta, GA combined with average rent of each neighborhood. We will train a linear regression model to predict rent prices of a neighborhood. This problem will require the use of Foursquare API to get local venues as well as data about rent and neighborhood location which will be aquired through various sources. This report should interest developers and landlords wondering where to build or how much to charge for rent as well as renters who are looking for a place to rent and are interested in how much is fair rent. Finally this report will also interest city officials who will be able to gain insight on certian venues effects on neighborhood rent."

    "\n",
    "   The neighborhoods that comprise the city of Atlanta are rich with history. Atlanta was the home of many civil rights leaders such as John Lewis, Ralph David Abernathy, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, and many more. The neighborhoods they resided in are decorated with tributes to their historic neighbors. However the neighborhoods of Atlanta have also been shaped by its less glamourous history. During the American Civil War Atlanta was a crucial stronghold of the confederacy due to the multiple railroads that intersected within the city making the city crucial for sending supplies to confederate troops throughout the South East. In 1864 during the Union Army's \"March to the Sea\" led by General William Sherman the city of Atlanta was burnt down (with some help from the retreating confederates) and it's residents displaced. After the Civil War ended in 1865, Atlanta began its rebuilding process which was accelerated due to the cities extensive railroad network. This rebuilding led to a boom in the city's population and the city of Atlanta was made the capital city of Georgia soon after. The city experienced significant growth through the late 1800's and early 1900's however racial tensions and Jim Crow laws would make a lasting mark on the city. In 1906 the Atlanta Race Riots forced black residents out of the booming Downtown Atlanta into the Sweet Auburn neighborhood which remains a predominantly black neighborhood to this day. Further red lining and segregation led to some very noticable differences throughout the neighborhoods such as roads being renamed as they pass through historically \"Black\" or \"White\" neighborhoods (i.e. Boulevard becoming Monroe and Moreland becoming Braircliff). After sustained growth through the 20th century including the construction of the world's busiest airport in south Atlanta, several interstates that pass through the city, establishing of universities within the city such as Georgia Tech, Morehouse, Emory University. The huge growth of Atlanta throughout the 20th century was capstoned with the 1996 Summer Olympics being hosted in the city. Current day Atlanta is composed of an incredibly diverse, well-educated, and young population which has grown over 24% in the last decade making it one of the fastest growing cities in the U.S. "
